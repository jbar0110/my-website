                        I am Jennell Barnett, a rising senior majoring in Hospitality Management at Florida International University. I'm a dedicated overachiever who strives to achieve greatness. I want to pursue a career in Hospitality Management due to my warm and welcoming personality and ability to provide comfort to others ensuring one is provided with phenomenal customer service and guest experience. Right now, I am pursuing a general track in Hospitality. Therefore, I am open to all aspects of the Hospitality industry including, events, travel, hotel, food, entertainment, etc.

                        My career goals are to hold and manage a high position such as CEO in whatever field of Hospitality I go in. My second goal is to run my own business or invent into something that is beneficial to people that would leave smiles on their faces. In my career, I hope to accomplish three main objectives: make a difference in society, be the best at what I do, and enjoy what I do. Those are the guidelines I will use to ensure I end up with a fulfilling, happy, and fruitful career. I would like to make a difference in society because I would like to give back and help the unfortunate. Furthermore, the community becomes stronger when people support one another, and that is what I want to achieve.

                       I enjoy dancing, skating, and learning new things. I like reading suspense books. I do believe anything is possible if one is self-driven and motivated. The world is filled with many opportunities. I am currently the senator of Hospitality for the Student Government Association, and a member of the Tau Sigma National Honor Society, the National Society of Minorities in Hospitality, and the Distributive Educational Clubs of America (DECA). I also tutor elementary kids who need help in reading. I enjoy seeing a little child become better at something they weren't before. Since I like to try new things, I am also taking belly dance and kickboxing courses. I look forward to bettering myself physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
